NAME
      tsh - Tiny Shell

SYNOPSIS
      Usage:

      $ ./tsh

DESCRIPTION
      tsh is a simple command line interpreter with job control mimicing that of bash.

COMMANDS
      The following builtin commands are built into tsh

      cd - changes the current directory

      fg - resume the most recently stopped job and bring it to the foreground.
           Supply an argument to fg to bring the job with that number to the
           foreground.

      bg - resume the most recently stopped job without bringing it to the foreground.
           Supply an argument to bg to resume the execution of that job.

      jobs - list all jobs, running or stopped

DESIGN

    tsh uses a linked list job control structure to keep track of running and
    stopped jobs.  All jobs are given a job number and a status integer, one of
    RUNNING, STOPPED, DONE, and TERMINATED.  The difference between DONE and
    TERMINATED is simply that backgrounded jobs finishing should only notify the
    user that they have finished once.  So when a background job is done, it is
    marked DONE, then once it gets printed, it is marked as TERMINATED.
    Foreground jobs go straight from DONE to TERMINATED.

    All jobs are kept in the list until the exit of the shell, when they are all
    freed. The status integer is used to avoid printing jobs that are already
    done.

    A global variable is used to keep track of the job currently running in the
    foreground.  This is used mainly for convenience, and in conjunction with a
    method that looks up a job in the joblist using a pid, and makes it simple
    to grab the pid of the job that was running in the foreground.
